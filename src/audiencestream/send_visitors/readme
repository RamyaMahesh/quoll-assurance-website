send_visitors

This is a simple Bash script that sends to visitors your local uconnect vagrant
instance for consumption by DataCloud.  Type:

  send_visitors -h

to get a list of parameters that this script accepts.  The script will also add
a randomly generated UDO variable called "badge_trigger" to each uconnect reqest
that can be used to assign a badge to the visitor within DataCloud.  The value
of the "badge_trigger" UDO variable will be a string in the range
'badge1'...'badge10'.  In order for the badge assignment functionality to work,
you will need to create a data object in TealiumIQ with name "badge_trigger".
Additionally, you will need to create badges in AudienceStream that are
assigned based on the value of this UDO variable.
